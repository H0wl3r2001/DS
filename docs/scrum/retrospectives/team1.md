## Sprint 1 Retrospective

### What went well?

- The user stories we delivered were functional and according to the way they were idealized.
- Good pull request documentation (Description and clarification).
- Code reviewing.

### What should we do differently?

- Start working sooner so that we have time to prevent and deal with delays from team members.
- Coordinate better with other teams so that our contributions don't conflict or our work gets discarded.
- Better communication with other team members so that we can better manage our workload during the sprint.

### What still puzzles me?

- We still have some problems with Docker.
- How branch naming should be done.
- How commits should be conventioned.
