## Sprint-Retrospective of the group (all 4 teams)
 This retrospectives, different from the individual team retrospectives, are focused on the communication between the teams during the sprint.
 These reflect on what went right, wrong and how to improve on the next sprint.

## Sprint 1

#### What went right?
 - We must award team 2 for being quick by developing an user story of big effort in such amout of time.
 - The communication between teams was good, since we communicated between each other in scenarios like PR reviews and doubts about the project.

#### What went wrong and how to improve
- We believed we could improve on the branch creation regarding conflicting user stories. To improve on that, we think we could have mid-sprint reunions. 
- We felt the sprint started too late, so let's start sooner
- Branches and commits' names are non-generic creating problems identifying its purpose. We should use naming conventions.
- Regarding development flux, we believe we do not have a good flux on branching and merging. We decided to have a `development`  branch which will be important to have a more stable `main`. This branch will be where all team branched will be born from. These branches should be short-lived but can be longer if needed. Three to four times a sprint, the person responsable for the merges, should be in charge of merging `dev` to `main`.
