# Factsheet for Filipe Fonseca

## Sprint 0

During the beggining of the srpint, the class was still divided and had no clear goal/objective. When this happened, I started organizing the whole class. I created objectives that needed to be done until the end of the sprint and was also able to understand what everyone was working in. This allowed me to give specific tasks to everyone in the class and made everyone have an objective. During this time, I also created the github repository and gave permission to all teams.
After assigning goals, I started working on market research to know what the other renting websites offer users. I compared our goals with the intelligent search options available in the other websites, writing a text about it which helped the construction of the product vision.


### The two user stories that I am most proud of

I did not participate in the construction of the user stories.


### The two pull requests that I am most proud of

In this Sprint, there weren't PRs.


### Two other contributions that I am especially proud of

1. Organizing the class and understanding what everyone was doing played a major role in uniting the class and creating a common objective.
2. Searching the competition allowed us to know what intelligent filters they had and how we'd be able to beat them.
