# Factsheet for LuÃ­s Vegas

## Sprint 0

Before our meeting with the PO from DevsScope I made sure I read the project specification available on Moodle and wrote down every doubt I had so that I could ask it to the PO during the meeting.

During the week after the meeting, I compiled my notes into a bullet-point list of topics useful for the elaboration of a product vision and shared them with my team.

Also during this sprint, I was responsible for writting the final version of the project's [Product Vision](https://github.com/FEUP-MEIC-DS-2022-1MEIC06/DS/blob/main/docs/product.md) and for [identifying the project main risks and justifying our choices showing the soundness of the technical vision](https://github.com/FEUP-MEIC-DS-2022-1MEIC06/DS/blob/main/docs/product.md). 

I also believe that I made valuable contribuitions in the class discussion where the class chose the development tools/environments/languages/frameworks.

## Sprint 1


During this sprint, as a scrum master, I was responsible for organizing my team's workload.I divided our assigned user stories into smaller work items and then I developed a Table in a spreadsheet where everyone could assign themselves the work item they were most comfortable in doing, always concerning equivalent work balance for everyone.

I also updated my team factsheets.

As a developer, I developed the code for [As a User, I want to be able to view the rental properties in a catalogue, so that I can see all available properties #7](https://github.com/FEUP-MEIC-DS-2022-1MEIC06/DS/issues/7) and did some code reviews for my colleagues.
