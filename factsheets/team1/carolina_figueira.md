# Factsheet for Carolina Figueira

## Sprint 0

I believe the most important work in this first Sprint was understanding the product and making sure all teams had the same basic idea of it. During the meeting with the PO and the following classes, I made sure my product vision was lined with other people's and explained my point of view verbally when it wasn't. In the product backlog's part, I was responsible for refining, editing and deleting duplicate user stories for the "Property Owner" actor, as well as designing mockups. I did not contribute much on the technical vision part, except for the group conversation we had regarding the important points from the "Choose development tools/environments/languages/frameworks" task.


### The two user stories that I am most proud of

In this first phase, it was important to make sure we covered all functionalities wanted by the PO. While working on the user stories I noticed that the most important ones were evident for different members of each team, but basic ones such as deleting posts or profiles, were being forgotten. Since I was responsible for refining the user stories associated with the "Property Owner" actor, I added a couple of user stories to also consider the CRUD paradigm in our project.

 * As a Property Owner, I want to remove my post, so that it is not available in the platform anymore.
 * As a Property Owner, I want to delete my profile, so that I no longer have an account in the platform.


### The two pull requests that I am most proud of

There were no PRs in this first Sprint.


### Two other contributions that I am especially proud of

I believe I was very helpful as a SPO in the work of understanding the product and the priorities of our PO. In a conversation during class with a couple of members from other teams, we made refinements to the UML Conceptual Model. We used all of our different perceptions of the product's goals and functionalities to create a final version of the Conceptual Model that made sense in our project. In this last part of the sprint, I worked along with Mariana Monteiro (Team 2) to create mockups of the different actor's user stories.
