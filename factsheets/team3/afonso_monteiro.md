# Factsheet for Afonso Monteiro

## Sprint 0

This sprint was more focused on getting information about the product to develop to know the issues to be tackled on.

After a meeting session with the Product Owner, a domain model could be drafted and finally develop the user stories.

My personal contribuition to this particular sprint was to, after studying the premisses of the project, actively participate in the meeting with the product owner to clear some doubts about the product and raise some questions so as certain details became more apparent.


### The two user stories that I am most proud of

This can include user stories that you have written or refined during the sprint. If it was a refinement, explain what you have added or changed.

I did not participate in the production of user-stories


### The two pull requests that I am most proud of

I have done no PRs


### Two other contributions that I am especially proud of

This can be anything that you think worked particularly well and benefited the project as whole, from a hard conversation with the PO that worked out very well, to the adoption of a new framework or library. 



## Sprint 1

For this sprint, the aim of the team was in developing part of the application's front-end, with special focus on the filtration of the available properties by text-searching for relevant attributes or by its price.

My personal contribution to this matter was in the development of the later filtration method.
