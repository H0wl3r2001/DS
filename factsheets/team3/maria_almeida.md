# Factsheet for Maria Francisca Almeida

## Sprint 0

During this initial sprint, we were all divided into groups and the roles were decided inside each team. Inside our team, we started to talk about which areas we liked the most so that we could decide which field we could take on during the whole project.
As a Scrum Master, I started to inform myself of the Scrum process according to *A Scrum Book*.
Later on, alongside my colleagues, we started to do a Market Research about housing websites in order to write a Product Vision.


### The two user stories that I am most proud of

I wrote the first draft for these user stories:

 1. As a **service provider**, I want to see the client's claims, so that I can take their complaints and suggestions and improve my services.					
 2. As a **service provider**, I want to receive client's solicitations, so that I can manage my schedule and decide if I accept them or not.					


### The two pull requests that I am most proud of

In this Sprint, there weren't PRs.


### Two other contributions that I am especially proud of

1. I helped writing some user stories, namely the ones that had to do with the service provider.
2. Being part of the Market Research
