# Factsheet for Edgar Torre

## Sprint 0

This sprint was mainly focused on understanding the challenge given to us, defining what it is and how we aim to develop the platform. Therefore, most contributions weren't individual but a team effort. However, some of the work done was individual, of which my contributions were a part of the user stories.

### The two user stories that I am most proud of

 * As a Property Owner, I want to see my tenants' data and our mutual contracts (previous and current), so that I can keep track of them.
 * As a Property Owner, I want to fill a complaint about a service, so that other Property Owners are aware of my review


### The two pull requests that I am most proud of

In this Sprint, there was no PR.


### Two other contributions that I am especially proud of

* Elaborating many of my team's user stories, especially the Property Owner ones
* Updating the information shown README.md (together with [João Andrade](https://github.com/FEUP-MEIC-DS-2022-1MEIC06/DS/blob/main/factsheets/team4/joao_andrade.md) from Team 4)


## Sprint 1

Together with [Afonso Monteiro](afonso_monteiro.md), during this sprint our task was to [filter properties by price](https://github.com/FEUP-MEIC-DS-2022-1MEIC06/DS/tree/price_range), using both a slider, which ranges from 0€ to 1000€, and direct text input. There were also some very small merge conflicts with other work being done, which were solved at the end of this sprint.


### The two user stories that I am most proud of

No user stories were written or refined during this sprint.
