# Factsheet for Margarida Ferreira

## Sprint 0

As a SPO, I collected the team's doubts about the project specification before the meeting with the PO, as well as the User Stories created by the team members. Furthermore, I sent an email to the PO presenting the SPOs and another with the User Stories (agreed upon by the class) to be validated and ordered. On top of that, I sought to promote communication and collaboration among the team.

As a Developer, I elaborated an initial draft of the Domain Model after analysing the project specification and then refined it after the kick-off meeting with the PO, turning it into a deliverable for Sprint 0. I created User Stories at a team level that were later used and modified by the developers assigned to the merge of the US. Finally, I estimated the User Stories' effort and inserted them in the Product Backlog in collaboration with Patrícia Oliveira from Team 1.

Toghether with Patrícia Oliveira (Team 1), I created a shared [Google Spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/12-TqostcRgZ4Utd63FHXF8R2RWtocwdAFs32cudrV6E/edit#gid=115740560) for planning and managing tasks, to promote between/inside teams communication and organization.

### The two user stories that I am most proud of

* As a User I want to be able to file complaints about the services I contract so that I can to expose my dislikes about them.
* As a User I want to be able to sign up/sign in via email/password so that I can register myself/login if I am not on social media.


### The two pull requests that I am most proud of

In this Sprint, there was no PR.


### Two other contributions that I am especially proud of

* The shared [Google Spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/12-TqostcRgZ4Utd63FHXF8R2RWtocwdAFs32cudrV6E/edit#gid=115740560) created toghether with Patrícia Oliveira (Team 1), created an environment that facilitated the assignment of tasks between and inside the teams, as well as keep track of its state.
* The elaboration of the Domain Model was important since it promoted a visual understanding of the project and allowed discussion between developers to arrive to a final model.

## Sprint 1


As a SPO, I sent an email to the PO for User Story order validation and participated in the Sprint Review meeting, presenting the developed features to de POs. Additionaly I wrote the [Sprint Review feedbacks](../../docs/scrum/sprint_reviews.md) for Sprints 0 and 1 which can be seen in [this commit](https://github.com/FEUP-MEIC-DS-2022-1MEIC06/DS/commit/6fc6f318305b2fa253da0613bc0499fb32842dce).

As a Developer, I implemented the US ['As a User, I want to search for a house by general location, so that I have more specific searching results'](https://github.com/FEUP-MEIC-DS-2022-1MEIC06/DS/issues/13) and updated the search according to the new parameters defined in the database which can be seen in [this commit](https://github.com/FEUP-MEIC-DS-2022-1MEIC06/DS/commit/fcb4688f37a94f0f5296795d4b7f1ad3eb1c10a6) (pair programming with Patrícia Oliveira from Team 1). Furthermore I did the Readme documentation in pair programming with Patricia Oliveira: https://github.com/FEUP-MEIC-DS-2022-1MEIC06/DS/commit/aa70dd62a38f83b6fbba9577402cfcf584280bdb, and was responsible for the sections DoR, DoD and Commit Messages.

I also updated the [Google Spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/12-TqostcRgZ4Utd63FHXF8R2RWtocwdAFs32cudrV6E/edit#gid=115740560) with the user stories' order, state and DoR for better organization of the class.
