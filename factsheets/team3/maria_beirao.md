# Factsheet for Maria BeirÃ£o

## Sprint 0

This sprint consisted in understanding the challenged assigned to us and deciding how to tackle it. Much of the work was a team effort in communication, of the remaining individual work I focused on the user stories, by writing some of the User's user stories and later organizing and standardizing the Renter's user stories.

### The two user stories that I am most proud of

 * As a renter, I want to be able to see my current to be paid rent, so that I know the updated value and due date.
 * As a User, I want to search for a house by distance to certain points of interest, so that I have more specific results					


### The two pull requests that I am most proud of

There were no pull requests on Sprint 0.

### Two other contributions that I am especially proud of

 * Posing many questions to the PO during the dialogue with them, thus contributing to the flow of discussion and to a better understanding of the desired product by everyone at a beginning stage.
 * Contributing to the discussion and decision making of how to tackle the organization of user stories at the starting stage, leading to a smoother task distribution and execution of organizing the user stories.
