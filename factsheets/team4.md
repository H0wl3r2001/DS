# Factsheet for Team 4 

## Sprint 0

In this sprint, the team started by getting to know each other, talking about their academic career. We ended up deciding the SPO and SM. After that, we had a meeting with the PO, where we got to know the expected and intended work. Then, with more autonomous work, one of our team members created the product backlog, other elements were involved in the creation of the UML diagram, the component diagram and the deployment diagram. We also had to work with Docker (setup), in the development of acceptance tests for 17 US and to work with other teams in product vision and market research.

### The four user stories that we are most proud of

 * #1 As a Property Owner, I want to edit details of my post, so that the platform is always updated on the conditions of my property;

## Sprint 1

In this sprint, we started by organizing a meeting to define what to do and assign tasks to each of the members, dividing into frontend and backend.
The USs delivered to our team had the main objective of creating the profile and editing page and creating an authentication system.
The tasks have not been completed, but they are very close to being done.
