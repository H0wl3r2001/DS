# Factsheet for Guilherme Garrido

## Sprint 0

In this sprint I created the Git board and respective columns (Product Backlog, Sprint Backlog, In progress and Done), configured the item's custom fields (sprint, effort and team) and developed the acceptance tests (not automated) for 17 User's user stories.


### The two user stories that I am most proud of

 * As a Property Owner, I want to edit details of my post, so that the platform is always updated on the conditions of my property - idea of this user story;
 * As a User I want to be able to sign up/sign in via email/password so that I can register myself/login if I am not on social media - developed the acceptance test.


### The two pull requests that I am most proud of

No pull requests made in sprint 0.


### Two other contributions that I am especially proud of

* Configuration of Product Backlog Items' custom fields (sprint, effort and team);
* Acceptance tests for 17 user stories.


## Sprint 1

In this sprint I worked on the User profile pages (view user and edition), mostly on the backend.

### The two user stories that I am most proud of


 * [As a User, I want to be able to set up a profile on the platform, so that I can improve my visibility among other users](https://github.com/FEUP-MEIC-DS-2022-1MEIC06/DS/issues/15). In this US, I developed the backend for the profile page and merged it with the frontend ([Profile Page Work Item](https://github.com/FEUP-MEIC-DS-2022-1MEIC06/DS/issues/3)). This US isnÂ´t 100% completed as it is missing the handling of permissions to access the users' profiles.
 * [As a User I want to be able to indicate the preferred contact for communication, so that other users will be able to contact me](https://github.com/FEUP-MEIC-DS-2022-1MEIC06/DS/issues/29). In this US, I had the idea to created a field in the database to store the preferred contact.


### The two pull requests that I am most proud of

I made no pull requests in this sprint as the features I worked on were not 100% done by the end of the sprint.


### Two other contributions that I am especially proud of

 * Refined the acceptance tests for the User's user stories of sprint 1.
 * Helped structuring the frontend for the [Edit profile page](https://github.com/FEUP-MEIC-DS-2022-1MEIC06/DS/issues/18).
