# Factsheet for Bernardo Ferreira

## Sprint 0

In sprint 0 the main focus was to prepare the team to develop the product successfully. We understand, with the help of the PO, the product defining its main features. We also defined technologies, architecture, and other important points to have everything prepared to start sprint 1. During this sprint, the contributions were done more as a team, despite some individual tasks. 
Individually, I help setup the base appication and the docker to start developing the product.
