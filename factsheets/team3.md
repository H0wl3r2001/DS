# Factsheet for Team 3 

## Sprint 0

During this first sprint, the team started to state their preferences in regards of the working methods. We decided who would take on as *SPO* and *SM*. After this was decided, everyone shared the area that they were most comfortable with so that we could later find ways to split the work.
Later on, we had a meeting with the *PO* where we started to draft the website and what functions were required for the project. With the planning done, the team devided themselves according to different roles and each wrote down some drafts for possible user stories.
Finally, we all divided ourselves to do tasks that were missing, such as writing the Product Vision, doing a market research, doing the Domain Model or organizing the user stories according to their priority.


### The four user stories that we are most proud of


 1. As a **renter**, I want to be able to see my current to be paid rent, so that I know the updated value and due date.
 2. As a **User** I want to be able to file complaints about the services I contract so that I can to expose my dislikes about them.
 3. As a **Property Owner**, I want to see my tenants' data and our mutual contracts (previous and current), so that I can keep track of them.
 4. As a **service provider**, I want to see the client's claims, so that I can take their complaints and suggestions and improve my services.

## Sprint 1

During this sprint, we were responsible of two US, the first one was ['As a User, I want to search for a house by general location, so that I have more specific searching results'](https://github.com/FEUP-MEIC-DS-2022-1MEIC06/DS/issues/13) and the other was ['As a User, I want to search for a house by cost range, so that I have more specific searching results'](https://github.com/FEUP-MEIC-DS-2022-1MEIC06/DS/issues/30). The first US was completed and considered done, but the second one had some merge conflicts that still need to be solved. Besides, we found some iprovements to this last user story that we wanted to implement.
