## Sprint 1

In this sprint, I've worked on:
- Gathering listings from Idealista and uploading it to the database.
- Remove mock/sample data from the base implementation and instead use real data fetched from Idealista.
- Aggregating previously scraped data from 4 different websites(Idealista, Olx, Uniplaces and Imovirtual) into a single collection.
- Doing some data cleaning that involved some of the following:  
  + Cast fields to desired format
  + Removal/Replacement of special characters such as € or $
- Updating the database to reflect the changes made while aggregating the collections.
